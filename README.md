## About Me
Hey! I am Ranai srivastav and I am currently a student in the Masters of Robotic Systems Development program in the Robotic Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. 

In robotics, my interests (in order of proficiency) lie in 
- Perception (What is the robot seeing?) [Project example]()
- Calibration, Localization, Mapping and State estimation (Where is the robot?) [Project Example]()
- High-level Robot Behavior Planning (What should the robot do?) [Project Example]()
- Multi-agent autonomy (Can the robot use some help?) [Project Example]()
