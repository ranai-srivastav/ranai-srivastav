## About Me
Hey! I am Ranai srivastav and I am currently a student in the Masters of Robotic Systems Development program in the Robotic Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. 

In robotics, my interests (in order of proficiency) lie in 

| Subfield | Description | Project Example Link |
|-|-|-|
| Perception (Classical CV) | What is the robot seeing? | [Project: Feature Tracking for VO using EKFs](https://github.com/castacks/smores_drone_software/tree/main/src/rovtio) |
| Perception (Multi-modal fusion) | Can many sensors help the robot see better? | Work in Progress |
| Calibration, Localization, Mapping, State Estimation | Where is the Robot and what is it experiencing? | [Project: SLAM from scratch](https://github.com/aayush-fadia/slam-project) |
| Algorithm and ML Optimization for Edge Devices | How fast can the robot think? | Work at Aurora Flight Sciences in the Summer of 2025 |
| High-level Robot Behavior Planning | What should the robot do and in what order? | [Project-Symbolic Planning](https://github.com/ranai-srivastav/SymbolicPlanning/tree/main) |
| Multi-agent coordination | How can each robot accomplish it's task? Can they work together? | Work in Progress |
