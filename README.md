## About Me
Hey! I am Ranai srivastav and I am currently a student in the Masters of Robotic Systems Development program in the Robotic Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. 

In robotics, my interests (in order of proficiency) lie in 
- Perception (What is the robot seeing?) [Project example] (https://github.com/ranai-srivastav/AdvCV_3dReconstruction/tree/Main)
- Calibration, Localization, Mapping and State estimation (Where is the robot?) [Project Example](https://github.com/aayush-fadia/slam-project)
- Algorithm/ML Optimization for edge devices (How quickly can the robot think?) (I'm still learning)
- High-level Robot Behavior Planning (What should it do?) (I'm still learning)
- Multi-agent autonomy (Can the robot use some help?) (I'm still learning)
